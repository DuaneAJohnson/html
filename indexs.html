                <p>While I was in the service
                    I spent two years in Berlin ,Germany.This is a picture of the famous Berlin Wall.<br>I had a chance to see the Berlin wall
                     before it came down and during.It did not look like this on both sides from<br> what I saw.
                     This must have been taken on the Western side....and yes,I do have a piece of the wall in my house.</p>
